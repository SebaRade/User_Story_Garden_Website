# User story map for my garden website

2021-03-16

**Background**
<br>
When we started to grow our own veggies, the scientist inside of me wanted to have some sort of a labbook. There were solutions available, but they were either too predefined and not matching my needs or they were too expensive. The easiest way was to build my own website. But before writing the HTML script, my husband (IT project manager for, inter alia, agile C2B app development) ~~forced me~~ suggested to first define the relevant functions.

**Results**
<br>
Thus, I split myself into two personae and persued their desired experiences:
<br>
- Dörthe, 31, scientist, no children, has a dog
  - As a scientist, I want to know what is growing and get botanical information.
  - I want to add images to find the plants more quickly when I forgot their names.
  - I want to retrieve the information directly in the garden from my mobile.
- Björn, 35, gardener, no children, has a dog
  - As a gardener, I want to document my work (e.g., time of seeding, germination rate) to improve in the next season.
  - I want to document the different subtypes of veggies and assign parameters like taste and yield quantitatively and qualitatively.
  - I want to know the growth condition of each plant so that I can take care appropriately during the season.
  - I want to have a calendar listing the timepoints when to bring out the seeds.

Based on these personae, I generated the user story map:

<br>

**Summary**
<br>
The website is very simple – editor-based and written only with HTML and CSS. Nonetheless, it provides all the information needed after few clicks.
